    * Jacob
        * Peer review other group’s project
        * Help Hunter with implementing Ability check roll on the front end. 
        * Add more Javadoc comments
* Report on Progress and Issues: 
    * Hunter - I finished the coding part of this and I even got some script running so the backend will work with an npm command. I feel like the end is coming up so I would like to do more collaborative work with the team so we can have somewhat of a better build plan for the final build. The PlayPage needs work and I would like for the rest of the people in the frontend team to contribute more. 
    * Joan -  I finished UI design for Play Page after the discussion with Allie about all the components and functions needed for the final release. Over the weekend, I met with the group members from both backend and frontend and we finished user data displaying and dice rolling function in Play Page.     
    * Steven - Well, I contributed to the new functionality that we need to implement for the backend, which is good, and we had a nice meeting so that the frontend and backend teams could stay on the same page, and I think it was useful. On the other hand, big projects/assignments in Compilers and Databases means I’m pretty busy with other work, and I haven’t contributed to the test suite as much as I’d like this week. I will try to get some done on Wednesday/Thursday, but it may need to wait for the weekend at this point. Reviewing another team’s project was fun and a good assignment. It was nice to see how others approached the project differently from us, and what the advantages/disadvantages might have been.
    * Allie - I’ve been sicker than a dog, not much work was done.
    * Jacob - I helped the front end tema (in combination with Steve) to implement the ability check roll on the UI and started working on the update functionality so health and coins could be changed by the user. I think we all are at the end of motivation, however we still made progress this week. No large issues appeared, we were strict with doing pull requests which actually helped us with finding an error. One of our commits was failing the build process so we were able to quickly fix that without any hassle. Reviewing another team’s project was interesting, and I learned a lot just from their repo structure… we could definitely have a cleaner structure. 
* Goals for the week: (bullet points)
    * Hunter
        * Work on the Play Page and make sure updated user data can be sent back to the server and updated at the backend
        * Work with the team to finalize on the UI Design
        * Complete documentation for any additional components in the frontend
    * Joan
        * Work on the Play Page and make sure updated user data can be sent back to the server and updated at the backend
        * Work with the team to finalize on the UI Design
        * Complete documentation for any additional components in the frontend
    * Steven
        * Contribute meaningfully to the test suite
        * Contribute to tidying up documentation and adding any error-checking to backend code that is necessary
        * Stay connected with the team so we are all on the same page as we head down the stretch toward the finish line on final release
    * Allie
        * Work with the backend team to ensure we have all the functionality working as intended for our final release
        * Work with both teams to do final bug fixing!
        * Make appropriate changes to documentation in the repository based on peer feedback
        * Write the script for the final release
