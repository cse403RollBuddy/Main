        * Write meaningful unit tests for as much of the backend code as possible (including the server)

        * Add more Javadoc comments
* Report on Progress and Issues: 
    * Hunter - 
    * Joan -  I finished UI design for Play Page after the discussion with Allie about all the components and functions needed for the final release. Over the weekend, I met with the group members from both backend and frontend and we finished user data displaying and dice rolling function in Play Page.     
    * Steven - Well, I contributed to the new functionality that we need to implement for the backend, which is good, and we had a nice meeting so that the frontend and backend teams could stay on the same page, and I think it was useful. On the other hand, big projects/assignments in Compilers and Databases means I’m pretty busy with other work, and I haven’t contributed to the test suite as much as I’d like this week. I will try to get some done on Wednesday/Thursday, but it may need to wait for the weekend at this point. Reviewing another team’s project was fun and a good assignment. It was nice to see how others approached the project differently from us, and what the advantages/disadvantages might have been.
    * Allie - Allie's on a sick leave this week
    * Jacob - 
* Goals for the week: (bullet points)
    * Hunter
        * 
    * Joan
        * Work on the Plag Page and make sure updated user data can be sent back to the server and updated at the backend
        * Work with the team to finalize on the UI Design
        * Complete documentation for any additional components in the frontend
    * Steven
        * Contribute meaningfully to the test suite
        * Contribute to tidying up documentation and adding any error-checking to backend code that is necessary
        * Stay connected with the team so we are all on the same page as we head down the stretch toward the finish line on final release
